Hi! This is a guideline to run the CNN codes.

1. Modify the file path in "make_dat.m".
    Run the "make_dat.m".
2. Run the "recipe_##_process.m"
3. Build a folder as the image data set. 
    Modify the file path to the folder in "CalNumPerImage.m". 
4. Run the "spectro_make.m".
5. Build subfolder for each recipe. The name of subfolder is the label of classification. 
    Store images into corresponding subfolder according the name of produced images.
6. Run the "CNN_TrainingAndTest.m"
